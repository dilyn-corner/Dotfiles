# dotfiles
A better $HOME, for you and me.


# Getting started

It's what you would expect.
I previously had a dotfiles repo, but it was junk. This is going to be better! Hopefully. 
I've already borked my system twice and had to rewrite all of these so it should be _stellar_. 

# Cloning

Don't. This is mine.
